Add authentication using social media networks (Twitter, WordPress, Google+, etc.) for blog comments

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add authentication using social media networks (Twitter, WordPress, Google+, etc.) for the users who want to comment on your blog.

The usage of this plugin does not oblige you to create an account on our website, like others plugins do.
All you need is to have an account (if you don’t have one, then you must create it) on the social network that you want to use as a source of authentication.
